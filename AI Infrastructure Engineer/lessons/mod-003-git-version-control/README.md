# Module 003: Git and Version Control

## Module Overview

Version control is the cornerstone of modern software development and infrastructure engineering. This module provides comprehensive training in Git, the industry-standard distributed version control system, and GitHub, the leading platform for collaboration and code hosting.

You'll learn not just how to use Git commands, but understand the underlying concepts that make Git powerful. You'll practice collaborative workflows, learn best practices for commit management, branching strategies, and how to handle complex scenarios that arise in real-world projects. These skills are essential for managing infrastructure as code, collaborating with teams, and maintaining professional development standards.

By the end of this module, you'll be confident using Git for daily work, contributing to team projects, and managing code effectively throughout its lifecycle.

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### Pitfall 1: Committing Too Much/Too Little
**Solution:** Practice atomic commits; each commit should represent one logical change

### Pitfall 2: Vague Commit Messages
**Solution:** Use Conventional Commits format; explain "why" not just "what"

### Pitfall 3: Working on Wrong Branch
**Solution:** Check branch before starting work; use `git status` frequently

### Pitfall 4: Fear of Merge Conflicts
**Solution:** Conflicts are normal; practice resolving them in safe environment

### Pitfall 5: Force Pushing to Shared Branches
**Solution:** Never force push to main/master; understand rebase implications

### Pitfall 6: Committing Secrets
**Solution:** Use .gitignore properly; scan before committing; use pre-commit hooks

### Pitfall 7: Large Binary Files
**Solution:** Use Git LFS; keep binaries out when possible; use .gitignore

### Pitfall 8: Detached HEAD State
**Solution:** Understand what HEAD means; create branch if making changes

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Problem: Merge Conflict
```bash
# Steps to resolve
git status  # Identify conflicted files
# Edit files to resolve conflicts
git add <resolved-files>
git commit  # Complete the merge
```

### Problem: Committed to Wrong Branch
```bash
# Solution using cherry-pick
git checkout correct-branch
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
git checkout wrong-branch
git reset --hard HEAD~1  # Remove from wrong branch
```

### Problem: Need to Undo Last Commit
```bash
# Keep changes
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Discard changes
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

### Problem: Lost Commits
```bash
# Find lost commits
git reflog

# Recover specific commit
git checkout <commit-hash>
git checkout -b recovery-branch
```
